"""On-demand deployment of the Telemetry framework onto a DUT.

Historically the Telemetry framework has been baked into every test image: the
chromeos-base/telemetry package installs it into /usr/local/telemetry, which is
part of the stateful partition payload (stateful.zst). That costs ~1.2 GiB of
stateful space on every DUT, including the large majority of DUTs that never run
an on-DUT Telemetry test:

  - Tast never uses on-DUT Telemetry.
  - Server-side Telemetry tests with telemetry_on_dut=False run the harness on
    the drone and drive the DUT with --browser=cros-chrome --remote=<dut>.

Only two consumers actually need the framework present on the DUT itself:

  A. Server-side tests with telemetry_on_dut=True, which ssh in and run
     /usr/local/telemetry/src/tools/perf/run_benchmark.
  B. Client-side autotest tests that import telemetry.* at module scope (most
     commonly via client/common_lib/cros/chrome.py).

This module provides the deployment primitive those consumers use so that the
framework can eventually be dropped from the image entirely. It fetches the
per-build dep tarball that the Chrome ebuild already publishes inside
autotest_packages.tar and extracts it into /usr/local/telemetry.

Only consumer A is wired up alongside this module; consumer B is served by
server/cros/telemetry_dependency.py, which lands separately.

Note that ensure_telemetry_on_dut() is a no-op on images that still ship
Telemetry, which is what makes it safe to land and bake before the image change.

Every failure raised out of this module is a TelemetryDeployError; _try_run() is
the single place where a host exception is converted into one, so callers can
attribute failures without listing autotest's exception hierarchy.
