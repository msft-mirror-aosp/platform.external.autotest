# This test verifies AVRCP media info sent by DUT can be received by peer.
# It verifies media information including: playback status, length, title,
# artist, and album.
# Steps:
# 1. Initialize the Bluetooth media player.
# 2. Update all media information twice to prevent previous leftover data affect
# the current iteration of test.
# 3. Compare the expected results against the information received on the peer
# device.
# 4. Return True if expected results equals the information received on the
# peer.
# 5. Cleanup for Bluetooth media player.
