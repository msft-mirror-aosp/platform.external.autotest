# Description
# This test runs a load test consisting of cycling though web pages, playing
# videos, etc. and measures battery power draw. The duration of this test is
# determined by the loop_time * loop_count variables below.

# This control file is simply meant to stimulate the various aspects of the test
# to validate mechanics are in good health (login, external website access).

# It ignores whether wired access (check_network=False) or AC is
# connected(ac_ok=True).

# For reasons above and reduced runtime (3min) it will NOT produce valid power
# consumption results for the 60/20/10/10 load and therefore should NOT be used
# for any battery life estimations.
