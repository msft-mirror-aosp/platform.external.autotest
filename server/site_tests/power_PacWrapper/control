DOC = """
This wrapper test automates the process of power measurement with a pacman
debugger while running a client test. Please check the client test's control
file for any hardware requirement, e.g. no AC power, no Ethernet.

This test makes the following assumptions:
1. Pacman Debugger is connected to the DUT and can be run manually.

2. The workstation (or where the autotest is kicked off from) should be in same
timezone with the DUT.

3. pacman.py is in path and discoverable using shutil.which('pacman.py')

Installation:
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/3.6/get-pip.py
sudo python ./get-pip.py
pip3 install pandas plotly pyftdi

Sample usage:
test_that <ip address of DUT> power_PacWrapper --args \
'test=power_LoadTest.fast config=./boards/skyrim/skyrim_r1.py'

What are the parameters:
test: the client test to run in wrapper test; DUT power is measured during this
      client test; required.
note: User supplied note to tag the specific test; optional.
