# A Batch of Bluetooth Quality Report health tests. This test is written
# as a batch of tests in order to reduce test time, since auto-test ramp
# up time is costly. The batch is using BluetoothAdapterQuickTests wrapper
# methods to start and end a test and a batch of tests.
#
# This class can be called to run the entire test batch or to run a
# specific test only
#
# Currently, the batch contains the following tests:
# - qr_a2dp_test
# - qr_hfp_nbs_dut_as_src_test
# - qr_hfp_wbs_dut_as_src_test
# - qr_disabled_a2dp_test
# - qr_a2dp_cl_keyboard_test
# - qr_hfp_wbs_dut_as_sink_cl_keyboard_test
# - qr_hfp_nbs_dut_as_sink_cl_keyboard_test
#
# Purpose: Batch of Bluetooth BQR health tests

# Deprecated variables:
#     TIME = 'SHORT'  # Approximately 15 mins
#     TEST_CATEGORY = 'Functional'
