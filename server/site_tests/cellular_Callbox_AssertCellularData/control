This test asserts the stability of cellular data on DUTs. This does so by
connecting to a CMW500 Callbox that is connected to the DUT, asserts that
the CMW500 Callbox is running a cellular simulation that is providing data
to the DUT via its cellular connection.  Then it asserts that the data
provided by that connection is identical to the data provided by the ethernet
connection on the DUT.
