# This class implements a Bluetooth quick health package, using
# methods provided in BluetoothAdapterQuickTests,
# The package is running several sub batches of tests.
# A batch is defined as a set of tests, preferably with a common subject, e.g
# 'LE Health' batch.
# The quick health test pacakge is imporving test time by doing the minimal
# cleanups between each test and test batches, saving the auto-test ramp up
# time of about 90-120 second per test.
#
# Purpose: Package of Bluetooth quick health tests

# Deprecated variables:
#     TIME = 'MEDIUM' # Takes 10 minutes on Guado
#     TEST_CATEGORY = 'Functional'
