DOC = """
This suite verifies ARC's basic functionality for the Android Pre-Flight Queue
by running ARC-specific Tast integration tests that must always pass against a
DUT. See http://go/tast for more information about Tast.

The following Autotest tests are executed by this suite:
- tast.critical-android, which is a server test that executes the tast
executable. The tast executable runs individual Tast tests. If any of these Tast
tests fail, then tast.critical-android (and this suite) fail.
- tast.arc-data-collector, which launches the arc.DataCollector Tast test to
collect runtime artifacts from the DUT for future optimization."""
