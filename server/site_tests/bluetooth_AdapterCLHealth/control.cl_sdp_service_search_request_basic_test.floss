# Verify the correct behaviour of the device when searching for services.

# The tester sends a Service Search Request to the DUT, searching the UUID of
# SDP Server Service, which is known to exist.
# Tester also searches for Service Class ID = 0x0001, which should never exist.
# In order to verify the correct behaviour of continuation state, some number of
# fake Bluetooth services are registered on the device. This is needed to create
# a request with a very long response, and to force the SDP server on the device
# to use this continuation state functionality.

# This test covers the following Bluetooth SIG test cases:
# TP/SERVER/SS/BV-03-C
# TP/SERVER/SS/BV-04-C

# The following tests are not yet supported in Floss:
# TP/SERVER/SS/BV-01-C
# TP/SERVER/SS/BI-01-C
# TP/SERVER/SS/BI-02-C
