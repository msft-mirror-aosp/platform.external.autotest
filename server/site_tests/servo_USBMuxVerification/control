"""
This test is to validate whether the usb stick on a (lab) servo device i.e. v2,
v3, and v4, can switch properly between servo host and dut host. It simply
checks that the stick becomes visible on the right side, given the mux state
and power state of the port.

Notes:
- Test fails if the servo doesn't have an image usb port
- Test fails if no usb block device with vid/pid/serial plugged into said port
