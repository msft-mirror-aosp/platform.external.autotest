DOC = """
This test case verifies that bgscan aborts and/or backs off when
there is consistent outgoing traffic. This is a fork of the legacy test
that runs the test on channels 149 and 153 to serve two purposes:
(a) provide more 5 GHz coverage.
(b) help (a wee bit) to catch noise concerns around 5760 MHz as seen on
certain Intel SoCs.
