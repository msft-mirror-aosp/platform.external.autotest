# Description
# This test simulates video call multitasking and record power related statistics
# while optionally force discharge.
# 
# Workload
# - Camera preview in 720p using VP9 codec.
# - Four 720p 30fps video playback with two VP8 videos and two VP9 videos.
# - Google Doc with emulated typing.
# 
# The fast version only runs for 3 minutes to make sure the test works as expected.
# 
# "FDO" is short for "force discharge optional." Test will use EC command to
# force DUT to discharge. If it fails, then use AC as the power source.
