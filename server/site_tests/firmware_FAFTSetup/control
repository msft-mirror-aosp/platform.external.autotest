This test checks the following FAFT hardware requirement:
  - Warm reset
  - Cold reset
  - Recovery boot with USB stick
  - USB stick is plugged into Servo board, not DUT
  - Keyboard simulation

If this test is run with parameter -a "spec_check=True", then hardware
testability is checked according to spec and without any current
workaround.
  - Strict keyboard simulation
  - Recovery mode with dedicated recovery signal
