    A package of Bluetooth LE HID sanity tests

    This test is written as a package of tests in order to reduce test time,
    since auto-test ramp up time is costy.
    Between each two test, the method _cleanup_and_restart is called to
    restart both peer and DUT. The HID device type can be selected per test
    using this method.
    At the end of each test, the method _update_test_result is called to track
    test results.
    At the end of the package, _print_test_results is called to print a summary
    of the test results.
