This is an example sequence, showing how to use the pvs_Sequence test class to
standardize sequence implementation in control files. When creating a new
sequence, start from this example implementation and:

(1) Make sure your NAME is in the form 'pvs_Sequence.<sequence-name>'
(2) Fill the SEQUENCE data structure below as the fields are indicated
