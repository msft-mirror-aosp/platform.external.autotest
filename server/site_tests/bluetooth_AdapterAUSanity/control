    A Batch of Bluetooth Bluetooth audio sanity tests. This test is written
    as a batch of tests in order to reduce test time, since auto-test ramp
    up time is costly. The batch is using BluetoothAdapterQuickTests wrapper
    methods to start and end a test and a batch of tests.

    This class can be called to run the entire test batch or to run a
    specific test only

    Currently, the batch contains the following tests:
    - au_a2dp_test
    - au_hfp_wbs_dut_as_source_test
    - au_hfp_wbs_dut_as_sink_test
