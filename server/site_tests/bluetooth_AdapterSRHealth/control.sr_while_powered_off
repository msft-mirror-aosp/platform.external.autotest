# This test verifies that the adapter should be able to power on and reconnect
# after it was powered off during suspend and resume
#
# Steps:
# 1. Pair a HID device
# 2. Power off the BT adapter
# 3. Suspend and resume the DUT
# 4. Power on the BT adapter; expect success
# 5. Expect that the device can initiate connection to the DUT
#
# Purpose: Verify the DUT can suspend and resume while the adapter is powered
# off

# Deprecated variables:
#     TIME = 'SHORT'
#     TEST_CATEGORY = 'Functional'
