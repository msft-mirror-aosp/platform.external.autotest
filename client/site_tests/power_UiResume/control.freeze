This test will search /var/log/messages for pertinent strings to determine if
the cpu is sleeping. It will wait for a number of seconds before suspending to
ram. It will then calculate how many seconds the system was suspended, and
how many seconds it took to resume. As a precaution it will ensure your
network interface is UP after it has resumed.

In order to match existing requirements, this test will execute three suspend
iterations, and provide keyvalues for all three.
