Run the unstable Tast tests which verify basic Cellular functionality.

"group:cellular" indicates that the test runs on DUTs with a Cellular modem.
"cellular_sim_active": Used to select tests that require a sim card .
"cellular_unstable": Unstable tests that will be included in this suite.

Tast is an integration-testing framework analagous to the test-running portion
of Autotest. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/ for
more information.

See http://go/tast-failures for information about investigating failures.
