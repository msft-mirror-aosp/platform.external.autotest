# This test case verifies that the Bluetooth adapter of the DUT can behave as
# a Bluetooth low-energy device and register a single advertisement with data
# and parameters correctly. This test case also verifies that the single
# advertisement could be registered and unregistered continuously.
#
# This autotest include the following test cases:
#   self.test_case_SI200_RA1_CD_UA1()
#   self.test_case_SI200_RA1_CD_RS()
#   self.test_case_RA1_CD_SI200_CD_UA1()
#   self.test_case_RA1_CD_SI200_CD_RS()
#   self.test_case_RA1_CD_SI200_CD_FSI10_UA1_RA1_CD_UA1()
#   self.test_case_RA1_CD_SI200_CD_FSI20000_UA1_RA1_CD_UA1()
#
# Specifically, the subtests included in this autotest verify the
# following operations and parameters.
#   - test_register_advertisement
#       * A single advertisement is registered successfully.
#       * The advertising min/max intervals are set correctly.
#           . The intervals are set to specified values.
#           . The intervals are set to default values after reset.
#       * The manufacturer id is set correctly.
#       * The service UUIDs are set correctly.
#       * The service data is set correctly.
#       * Advertising is enabled consequently.
#   - test_reset_advertising
#       * The single advertisement instance is removed.
#       * Advertising is disabled consequently.
#
# Mnemonics of the test cases:
#     CD: check advertising duration and intervals
#     RA: register advertisements
#     UA: unregister advertisements
#     SI: set advertising intervals
#     RS: reset advertising
#     FSI: fail to set advertising intervals beyond legitimate range
#          of [20 ms, 10,240 ms].
#     SR: suspend and resume the DUT (chromebook)
