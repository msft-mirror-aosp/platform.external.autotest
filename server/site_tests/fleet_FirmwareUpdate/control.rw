This test is designed to simulate the same firmware update behavior that
a ChromeOS user would have. We don't need OS update since it should be handled
by prejob(provision) already. And this test will update OS bundled firmware(RW only)
from the DUT and doing some post-update validation. The test includes below steps:

1. Pre-update validation.
2. Update DUT to OS bundled firmware via /usr/sbin/chromeos-firmwareupdate(RW only).
3. Reboot.
4. Post-update validation.
