            This test checks if the speech quality is improved by NC when the
            input is mixed with noises. During the test, the speech and noise
            files will be mixed and played by Chameleon, while DUT records via
            the internal mic with NC enabled and disabled respectively. The
            score difference calculated by ViSQOL with the speech file as
            reference should not be less than the threshold specified in
            test_data.
