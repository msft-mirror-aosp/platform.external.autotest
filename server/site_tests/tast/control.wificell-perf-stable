Run the stable Tast tests which measure WiFi performance.

"group:wificell" indicates that the test runs on a wificell fixture. Its
sub-attributes:
  * "wificell_perf": the test is used to measure WiFi performance.
  * "wificell_unstable": the test is unstable or yet to be verified as stable.

Tast is an integration-testing framework analagous to the test-running portion
of Autotest. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/ for
more information.

See http://go/tast-failures for information about investigating failures.
