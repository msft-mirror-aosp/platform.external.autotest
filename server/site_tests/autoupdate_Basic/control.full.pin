This tests an N-to-N update. That means it will update to the same version
that the DUT was provisioned with. This test will be used in the CQ to ensure
changes don't break autoupdate.

In the lab, a job_repo_url will be passed directly to the test. It contains
information about the build to use and the IP address of lab cache server to
download update payloads from. Local runs can use cache servers as well but
the setup is fairly complicated.

Instead you can use the `running_at_desk` arg when running tests locally to
avoid the extra setup needed to access cache servers from your workstation.
`running_at_desk` will copy payloads from gs://chromeos-image-archive/ to a
public bucket that is accessible without additional configuration.

Example usage:

You can specify the build to AU to for full updates. It should be greater
than or equal to the version currently on the DUT:
test_that <DUT> autoupdate_Basic.full.pin --board=<board> --args="running_at_desk=True build=R102-14643.0.0"

If no build is specified, the current version on the DUT will be used:
test_that <DUT> autoupdate_Basic.full.pin --board=<board> --args="running_at_desk=True"
