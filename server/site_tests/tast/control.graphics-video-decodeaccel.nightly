Run the Tast graphics-video-decodeaccel test suite.

Tast is an integration-testing framework analagous to the test-running portion
of Autotest. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/ for
more information.

This test runs decodeaccel tests against a remote DUT.
Separate control files are needed because Tast doesn't isolate tests from each
other and a clean device state is needed by rebooting before running a
different graphics suite.

See http://go/tast-failures for information about investigating failures.
