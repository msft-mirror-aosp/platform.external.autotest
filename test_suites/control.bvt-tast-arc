This suite verifies ARC's basic functionality for ARC variant boards
(e.g. *-arc-r) in the ChromeOS CQ, by running ARC-specific Tast integration
tests that must always pass against a DUT. See http://go/tast for more
information about Tast.

The only Autotest test executed by this suite is tast.critical-android, which is
a server test that executes the tast executable. The tast executable runs
individual Tast tests. If any of these Tast tests fail, then
tast.critical-android (and this suite) fail. """
