This test requires a USB disk plugged-in, which contains a ChromeOS test
image (built by "build_image test"). On runtime, this test first switches
DUT to developer mode. It then checks the kernel and firmware version stored in
the TPM. It then boots into normal mode and checks the kernel and firmware
version in the TPM to ensure they weren't corrupted.
