# A Batch of Bluetooth Advertisement Monitor API tests. This test is written
# as a batch of tests in order to reduce test time, since auto-test ramp up
# time is costly. The batch is using BluetoothAdapterQuickTests wrapper
# methods to start and end a test and a batch of tests.
#
# This class can be called to run the entire test batch or to run a specific
# test only. More information about the tests can be found here:
# go/bt-advmon-api-test-plan

#
# Purpose: batch of Bluetooth Advertisement Monitor tests

# Deprecated variables:
#     TIME = 'LONG'  # ~10 minutes
#     TEST_CATEGORY = 'Functional'
