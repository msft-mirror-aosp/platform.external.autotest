# This test case verifies that the Bluetooth adapter of the DUT can behave as
# a Bluetooth low-energy device and register multiple advertisements with
# data and parameters correctly. This test case also verifies that
# advertisements could be registered and unregistered continuously.
#
# Specifically, this autotest include the following test cases:
#   self.test_case_SI200_RA3_CD_UA3()
#   self.test_case_SI200_RA3_CD_RA1_CD_UA1_CD_UA3()
#   self.test_case_SI200_RA3_CD_RS()
#   self.test_case_SI200_RA3_CD_UA1_CD_RS()
#   self.test_case_SI200_RA3_CD_UA1_CD_RA2_CD_UA4()
#   self.test_case_RA3_CD_SI200_CD_UA3()
#   self.test_case_RA3_CD_SI200_CD_RS()
#   self.test_case_RA3_CD_SI200_CD_UA1_CD_RS()
#   self.test_case_RA3_CD_SI200_CD_SI2000_CD_UA3()
#   self.test_case_RA3_CD_SI200_CD_FSI10_CD_FSI20000_CD_UA3()
#
# Mnemonics of the test cases:
#   CD: check advertising duration and intervals
#   RA: register advertisements
#   UA: unregister advertisements
#   SI: set advertising intervals
#   RS: reset advertising
#   FSI: fail to set advertising intervals beyond legitimate range of [20 ms,
#   10,240 ms].
#
# Every test case consists of a sequence of tests:
#   test_register_advertisement
#       * All advertisements are registered successfully.
#       * The advertising min/max intervals are set correctly.
#           . The intervals are set to specified values.
#           . The intervals are set to default values after reset.
#       * The manufacturer id is set correctly.
#       * The service UUIDs are set correctly.
#       * The service data is set correctly.
#       * Advertising is enabled consequently.
#   test_reset_advertising
#       * All advertisement instances are removed.
#       * Advertising is disabled consequently.
#   test_check_duration_and_intervals
#       * The duration is correct.
#       * The new advertising intervals are set correctly.
#   test_unregister_advertisement
#       * The advertisement is removed.
#       * Advertising is disabled when the last one is removed.
