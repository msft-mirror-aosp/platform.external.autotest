# Description
# This test measures the power draw during suspend.
# 
# Test uses RTC wake to transition from suspend to S0 every sample_hours for a
# total standby time of test_hours.  The suspend to S0 transitions are added to
#  1. Validate battery use
#  2. Guarantee that suspend was maintained (no external/false wake)
#  3. Create transitions which more closely model user's interaction.
# The 5 minutes version is intended to use with power measurement telemetry device
# as the battery gas gauge would not be accurate enough to measure power this low.
