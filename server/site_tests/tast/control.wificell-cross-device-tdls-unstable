Run Tast tests for basic TDLS WiFi functions on suite:wifi_nearby.

"group:wificell_cross_device" indicates that the test runs on a nearbyshare
 fixture. Its sub-attributes:
  * "wificell_cross_device_tdls": test WiFi TDLS functionality.
  * "wificell_cross_device_unstable": the test is unstable or yet to be
                                      verified as stable.

Tast is an integration-testing framework analagous to the test-running portion
of Autotest. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/ for
more information.

See http://go/tast-failures for information about investigating failures.
