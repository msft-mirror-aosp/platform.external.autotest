    A Batch of Bluetooth Quality Report health tests. This test is written
    as a batch of tests in order to reduce test time, since auto-test ramp
    up time is costly. The batch is using BluetoothAdapterQuickTests wrapper
    methods to start and end a test and a batch of tests.

    This class can be called to run the entire test batch or to run a
    specific test only

    Currently, the batch contains the following tests:
    - qr_a2dp_test
    - qr_hfp_nbs_dut_as_src_test
    - qr_hfp_wbs_dut_as_src_test
    - qr_disabled_a2dp_test
    - qr_a2dp_cl_keyboard_test
    - qr_hfp_wbs_dut_as_sink_cl_keyboard_test
    - qr_hfp_nbs_dut_as_sink_cl_keyboard_test
