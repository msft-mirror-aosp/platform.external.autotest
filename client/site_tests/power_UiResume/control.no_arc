# Description
# This test will search /var/log/messages for pertinent strings to determine if
# the cpu is sleeping. It will wait for a number of seconds before suspending to
# ram. It will then calculate how many seconds the system was suspended, and
# how many seconds it took to resume. It will also parse the ARC logcat to measure
# how many seconds it took for ARC to suspend and then resume. As a precaution it
# will ensure your network interface is UP after it has resumed.
