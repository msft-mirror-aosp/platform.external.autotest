# In 4 hours of runs, we need to make sure the DUT can keep the autoserv SSH
# connection alive a few times. Increase the time "awake" to 0 to 8 seconds,
# to occasionally leave more time for some network traffic.
# Tested with the current default autoserv connection parameters:
# ServerAliveInterval=900 ServerAliveCountMax=3
