The CBFS metadata cache size in coreboot is configured by CONFIG_CBFS_MCACHE_SIZE
(x86) or the size of the CBFS_MCACHE() region defined in memlayout (arm). If the
mcache overflows, the platform will still boot securely but needs to read data
from flash more times than necessary, leading to avoidable boot time impact. If
this test fails, the mcache size should be increased until it doesn't. (If the
RW mcache overflows by a lot, adjusting CONFIG_CBFS_MCACHE_RW_PERCENTAGE may
also be interesting.)
