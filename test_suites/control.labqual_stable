This is the stable labqual test suite.

It will be used to qualify DUTs for low-touch lab deployment in the future.
This suite focuses on updating and recovery since these are critical for the low-touch lab. In the future DUTs must pass these tests 100% before entering the lab, so only tests that are critical should be included.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on.  Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
@param SKIP_IMAGE: (optional) If present and True, don't re-image devices.
