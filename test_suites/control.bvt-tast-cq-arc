This suite verifies ChromeOS's basic functionality for the ChromeOS Commit
Queue by running all Tast integration tests in the "arc" category that must
always pass against a DUT. See http://go/tast for more information about Tast.

The only Autotest test executed by this suite is tast.category-arc, which
is a server test that executes the tast executable. The tast executable runs
individual Tast tests. If any of these Tast tests fail, then the
test.category-arc test (and this suite) fail.
