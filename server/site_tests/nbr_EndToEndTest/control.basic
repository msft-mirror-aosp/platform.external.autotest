DOC = """
This tests an N-to-M recovery. This means that it will recover from a ToT install
to the current stable. This test will be used in the CQ to ensure that changes
don't break NBR.

In the lab, a job_repo_url will be passed directly to the test. It contains
information about the build to use and the IP address of lab cache server to
download update payloads from. Local runs can use cache servers as well but
the setup is fairly complicated.

Instead you can use the `running_at_desk` arg when running tests locally to
avoid the extra setup needed to access cache servers from your workstation.
`running_at_desk` will copy payloads from gs://chromeos-image-archive/ to a
public bucket that is accessible without additional configuration.

Example usage:
test_that nbr_EndToEndTest.basic <DUT> --board=<board> --args="running_at_desk=True build=RXX-XXXXX.X.X"
