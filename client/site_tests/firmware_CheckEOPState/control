DOC = """
Intel x86 CPUs come with a Management Engine (going by more complicated
names sometimes, look for ME, CSE or CSME) that coordinates various
tasks during boot and after.

That coprocessor needs to know when the boot process is complete so
it can reject privileged boot-only requests until next reboot.

This test PASSES if the ME reports that it's in Post-Boot State.

This test FAILS if any of the following is true:
 - The Intel microarchitecture isn't defined in client/bin/utils.py
 - The ME reports it's not in Post-Boot State. This is the main condition.
 - The ME's firmware supports a sufficiently new protocol but returns
   failure to execute the query, failure to understand the query, responded
   to a different query or returns an unexpectedly formatted response.
 - The kernel doesn't provide a /dev/mei0 device even though we expect
   it to be there.

This test reports NA if any of the following is true:
 - The test is executed on non-Intel CPUs (e.g. AMD or ARM)
 - The ME reports an old protocol version where we can't query the
   state. (At least Sky Lake-E and older)
