# A Batch of Bluetooth advertising health tests. This test is written as a
# batch of tests in order to reduce test time, since auto-test ramp up time
# is costy. The batch is using BluetoothAdapterQuickTests wrapper methods to
# start and end a test and a batch of tests.
#
# Purpose: batch of Bluetooth advertising tests

# Deprecated variables:
#     TIME = 'LONG'  # ~25 minutes on Eve
#     TEST_CATEGORY = 'Functional'
