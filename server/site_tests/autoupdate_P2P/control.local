This tests autoupdate between two devices via peer to peer.

Use this control file to debug the test at your desk. The test requires the
lab to schedule and provision two DUTs before the test begins. We will need
to do that setup manually before running the test.

Steps to run from your desk:
1. Lease two DUTs in the lab. They need to be the same make/model and near
each other.
2. ssh into both and make sure they can ping each other.
3. Provision both DUTs to the same build. You can use cros flash to do this.
4. Pass two args to test_that: companion_hosts and job_repo_url.

A job_repo_url is a URL passed to each test that points to the autotest
packages. The AU tests use that url to figure out the devserver to use for the
test. When you are running locally you need to pass in a job_repo_url. An
example is:
http://100.115.245.194:8082/static/caroline-release/R82-12887.0.0/autotest/packages

test_that <hostname>.cros autoupdate_P2P.local --companion_hosts="<hostname2>.cros" --args="job_repo_url=<job_repo_url> with_dlc=True"
