DOC = """
This test is to ensure that we can provision out of a given build.
When running this test with a cros-version label, the scheduler
does the first-round provision by scheduling a provision special task
on the host. And then this test is run to enforce a second-round
provision that verifies the auto-update actually works.

What does the failure of this test mean?

If this test fails, any DUT with this build is likely going to require
re-imaging from USB. We decided to add this test to bvt-inline and run it
in parrallel with other tests, which means by the time this test reports
failure, many duts in the pool will have been imaged with the bad build.

We are taking the risk because
1) Blocking all testing until this test ran would impose a per-build
   performance cost we don't want to pay.
2) History suggests that bugs of this sort are very rare.
3) We hope that in future, servo will be sufficiently reliable to offset
   this kind of failure.

To run this locally, follow the instructions in provision_AutoUpdate.control and
use provision_AutoUpdate.double test instead.
