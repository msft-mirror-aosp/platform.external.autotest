# Description
# This test will search /var/log/messages for pertinent strings to determine if
# the cpu is sleeping. It will wait for a number of seconds before suspending to
# ram. It will then calculate how many seconds the system was suspended, and
# how many seconds it took to resume. As a precaution it will ensure your
# network interface is UP after it has resumed.
#
# In order to match existing requirements, this test will execute three suspend
# iterations, and provide keyvalues for all three.
