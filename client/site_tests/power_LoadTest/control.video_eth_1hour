# Description
# This test runs a load test consisting of cycling though web pages, playing
# videos, etc. and measures battery power draw, on Ethernet instead of WiFi.
# The duration of this test is determined by the seconds variable.
# The following manual steps need to be performed on the device under test
# before this test can be run:
#   - make sure that Ethernet cable is connected and WiFi is disabled
#   - disconnect power cable
