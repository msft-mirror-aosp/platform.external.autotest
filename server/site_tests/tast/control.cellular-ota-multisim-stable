Run the stable Tast tests which verify Cellular multi-sim functionality.

"group:cellular": indicates that the test runs on DUTs with a Cellular modem.
"cellular_sim_dual_active": indicates that the test runs on DUTs with a Cellular
modem and multiple provisioned SIM slots.
"cellular_unstable": Unstable tests that will be excluded from the stable suite.

Tast is an integration-testing framework analagous to the test-running portion
of Autotest. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/ for
more information.

See http://go/tast-failures for information about investigating failures.
