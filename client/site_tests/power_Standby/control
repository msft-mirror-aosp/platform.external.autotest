# Description
# This test measures the power draw during standby (S3).

# Test uses RTC wake to transistion from S3 to S0 every sample_hours for a total
#   standby time of test_hours.  The S3->S0 transistions are added to
#   1. Validate battery use
#   2. Guarantee that S3 was maintained (no external/false wake)
#   3. Create S3->S0->S3 transistions which more closely model user's interaction.

# Arguments:
#   sample_hours: float, number of hours between charge use samples.
#   test_hours: float, the number of hours to run the test.

# Test must meet the following criteria:
#   Battery must contain ~20% of its charge.
#   Must be run on battery power
#   sample_hours > 0.1
#   test_hours > sample_hours
