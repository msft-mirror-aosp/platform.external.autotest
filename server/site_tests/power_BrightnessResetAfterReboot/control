# Description
# This test:
# 1. Checks that ambient light sensor exists if specified in powerd prefs.
# 2. Checks that the default brightness after initial boot is reasonable.
# 3. Changes the brightness level to min (0%) and max (100%).
# 4. Checks that the brightness level resets after rebooting the device.

# The test fails if:
# -Ambient light sensor does not exist even though specified in powerd prefs.
# -Initial brightness is not reasonable.
# -Device not able to change brightness to min and max levels.
# -Device not able to set the brightness level to default after reboot.

# Note: for devices with ambient light sensor, test will allow for a small change
# in internal display brightness; test will fail if internal display brightness
# changes drastically.

# Example usage:
# test_that -b <board> <host> power_BrightnessResetAfterReboot
