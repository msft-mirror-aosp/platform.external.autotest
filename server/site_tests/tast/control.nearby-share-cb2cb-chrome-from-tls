Runs the Tast Nearby Share remote tests with a custom chrome binary.

These Nearby Share tests require two chromebooks, so we must provision
both DUTs with the custom chrome binary before the tests are kicked off.

This test is used by Chrome builder for Nearby Share CI/CQ purposes.
A chrome builder creates a chrome binary and artifacts,
which is in turn provisioned to both DUTs through TLS.

Tast tests uses the sideloaded version of chrome for testing.
