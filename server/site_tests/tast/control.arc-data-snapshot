Run arc-data-snapshot Tast tests.

Tast is an integration-testing framework analagous to the test-running portion
of Autotest. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/ for
more information.

This test runs Tast-based ARC data/ snapshot related tests against a remote DUT.
This is a smoke test and verifies a whole ARC data/ snapshot flow, that requires
several reboots, app downloads and takes a considerable amount of time to be
added to the existing test suites.
