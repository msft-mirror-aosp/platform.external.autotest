This test checks that all RPC functions on all subsystems are connected,
and that they roughly work as expected.

This control file should not be automatically run.
Instead, each subsystem has its own control file.
That way, issues occurring in a particular subsystem will be easy to spot.
This control file is, however, useful for manual testing.
