# Description
# This test runs a load test consisting of cycling though web pages, playing
# videos, etc. and measures battery power draw. The duration of this test is
# determined by loop_time * loop_cnt.
#
# This version of test allows:
#   - AC is connected.
#   - Ethernet is connected.
#   - Use web caching
#
# This control file is simply meant to stimulate the various aspects of the test
# to validate mechanics are in good health (login, external website access).
#
# For reasons above and reduced runtime (5min) it will NOT produce valid power
# results for the 60/20/10/10 load and therefore should NOT be used
# for any battery life estimations.
