# Description
# Device should be plugged into an AC outlet.

# This test depends on power_status.py, which is included in
# autotest/files/client/cros/power/. power_status.py has many status
# initialization and parsing routines for battery status.

# Sample usage:
# test_that <ip address of DUT> power_BatteryCharge.args \
# --args 'percent_charge_to_add=100'

# test_that <ip address of DUT> power_BatteryCharge.args \
# --args 'percent_target_charge=95'

# What are the parameters:
# percent_charge_to_add: percentage of the charge capacity charge to
#                        add. The target charge will be capped at the charge
#                        capacity. Optional.
# percent_target_charge: percentage of the charge capacity target charge. The
#                        target charge will be capped at the charge capacity.
#                        Optional.
# test_for_charging_speed: indicates if the test is used for measuring charging
#                        speed or not
