This test simulates video call multitasking and record power related statistics
while optionally force discharge.

Workload
- Camera preview in 720p using VP9 codec.
- Four 720p 30fps video playback with two VP8 videos and two VP9 videos.
- Google Doc with emulated typing.

The fast version only runs for 3 minutes to make sure the test works as expected.

Test will use EC command to force DUT to discharge. If it fails, then use AC as the power source.
