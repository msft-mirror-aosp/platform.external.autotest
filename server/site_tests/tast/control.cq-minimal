Run cq-minimal Tast tests.

Tast is an integration-testing framework analagous to the test-running portion
of Autotest. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/ for
more information.

This runs a group of cq-minimal tests.

The goal of these tests is to verify a build is bisectable and debuggable.
