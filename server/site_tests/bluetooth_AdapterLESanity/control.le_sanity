    A Batch of Bluetooth LE sanity tests. This test is written as a batch

    costy. The batch is using BluetoothAdapterQuickTests wrapper methods to
    start and end a test and a batch of tests.

    This class can be called to run the entire test batch or to run a
    specific test only - todo http://b/132199238 [autotest BT quick sanity]
    add support for running a single test in quick test
