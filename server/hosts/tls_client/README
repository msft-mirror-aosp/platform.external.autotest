Protos in this dir are generated using buildprotos.py and manually checked
into the tree. The source of the protos is
src/config/proto/chromiumos/config/api/test/tls/commontls.proto, and
src/config/proto/chromiumos/config/api/test/tls/dependencies/longrunning/operations.proto
relative to a standard repo.
(https://chromium.git.corp.google.com/chromiumos/config/+/HEAD/proto/chromiumos/config/api/test/tls/commontls.proto)
If there are updates to src proto, the protos here must be re-generated. Run the
script "buildprotos.py" to automatically rebuild them from the source. You must
manually repo sync prior to this. If there are changes to the file structure
in the source, buildprotos.py will need to be updated for this.
